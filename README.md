Several *datasets* are fostering innovation in higher-level functions for everyone, everywhere. By providing this repository, we hope to encourage the research community to focus on hard problems. In this repository, we present a limited sampling of our medical imaging [DICOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM) files of patients resulted from our [User Tests and Analysis 11 (UTA11)](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta/wiki/User-Research#user-test-evaluations-) study. Here, we provide a [`dataset/`](dataset/) of the used medical images during the [UTA11](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta/wiki/User-Research#user-test-evaluations-) tasks. This repository and respective *dataset* should be paired with the [`dataset-uta11-rates`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/dataset-uta11-rates) repository *dataset*. Paired to the [`dataset-uta11-rates`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/dataset-uta11-rates) repository, this [`dataset-uta11-dicom`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/dataset-uta11-dicom) repository was also used with support of the [`dataset-uta11-findings`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/dataset-uta11-findings) repository. Work and results are published under the master thesis of Jo√£o Fernandes. Results were analyzed and interpreted on our [`sa-uta11-results`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/sa-uta11-results) repository. The user tests were made in clinical institutions, where clinicians diagnose several patients for an assertiveness-based communication. For example, in these tests, we used the [`prototype-assertive-proactive`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/prototype-assertive-proactive), [`prototype-assertive-reactive`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/prototype-assertive-reactive), [`prototype-non-assertive-proactive`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/prototype-non-assertive-proactive), and [`prototype-non-assertive-reactive`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/prototype-non-assertive-reactive) repositories for the comparison. On the same hand, the hereby *dataset* represents the pieces of information of both [BreastScreening](https://BreastScreening.github.io) and [MIDA](https://mida-project.github.io) research works. These projects are research projects that deal with the use of a recently proposed technique in literature: [Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network). From a developed User Interface (UI) and *framework*, these deep networks will incorporate [several public datasets](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta/wiki/Datasets) in different modes. For more information about the available *datasets* please follow the [public datasets](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta/wiki/Datasets) page on the [public wiki](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta/wiki) of the [`meta`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta) or the [private wiki](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta-private/wiki) of the [`meta-private`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta-private) repositories. Last but not least, you can find further information on the [Wiki](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/dataset-uta11-dicom/wiki) in this repository. We also have several demos to see in our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPz4aTIVHekHXTxHTUOLmXw), please follow us.

abstract = {Intelligent agents are showing increasing promise for clinical decision-making in a variety of healthcare settings. While a substantial body of work has contributed to the best strategies to convey these agents‚Äô decisions to clinicians, few have considered the impact of personalizing and customizing these communications on the clinicians‚Äô performance and receptiveness. This raises the question of how intelligent agents should adapt their tone in accordance with their target audience. We designed two approaches to communicate the decisions of an intelligent agent for breast cancer diagnosis with different tones: a suggestive (non-assertive) tone and an imposing (assertive) one. We used an intelligent agent to inform about: (1) number of detected findings; (2) cancer severity on each breast and per medical imaging modality; (3) visual scale representing severity estimates; (4) the sensitivity and specificity of the agent; and (5) clinical arguments of the patient, such as pathological co-variables. Our results demonstrate that assertiveness plays an important role in how this communication is perceived and its benefits. We show that personalizing assertiveness according to the professional experience of each clinician can reduce medical errors and increase satisfaction, bringing a novel perspective to the design of adaptive communication between intelligent agents and clinicians.},

## Prerequisites

The following list is showing the required dependencies for this project to run locally:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) or any other Git or GitHub version control tool
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) (3.5 or newer)

Here are some tutorials and documentation, if needed, to feel more comfortable about using and playing around with this repository:

* [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
* [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
* [GitHub Quick Tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

## Usage

Usage follow the instructions here to setup the current repository and extract the present data. To understand how the hereby repository is used for, read the following steps.

### Installation

At this point, the only way to install this repository is manual. Eventually, this will be accessible through [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) or any other package manager, as mentioned on the [roadmap](#Roadmap).

Nonetheless, this kind of installation is as simple as cloning this repository. Virtually all Git and GitHub version control tools are capable of doing that. Through the console, we can use the command below, but other ways are also fine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/dataset-uta11-dicom.git
```

Optionally, the module/directory can be installed into the designated Python interpreter by moving it into the site-packages directory at the respective Python directory.

### Demonstration

Please, feel free to try out our demo. It is a script called `demo.py` at the `src/` directory. It can be used as follows:

```bash
python src/demo.py
```

Or, you can run the shell script by:

```bash
./scripts/reader.sh
```

Just keep in mind this is just a demo, so it does nothing more than loading the DICOM image located at some path using `pydicom.dcmread`, which returns a `Dataset` object. We can access the pixel data from the dataset using the `pixel_array` attribute, which is a [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) array representing the image. Finally, we use `matplotlib` to display the image. The `cmap=plt.cm.bone` argument sets the colormap to grayscale, which is often used for medical images. Also, we did our best to make the demo as user-friendly as possible, so, above everything else, have fun! üòÅ

## Roadmap

[![CII Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/3819/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/3819)

We need to follow the repository goal, by addressing the thereby information. Therefore, it is of chief importance to scale this solution supported by the repository. The repository solution follows the best practices, achieving the [Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/3172) specifications.

Besides that, one of our goals involves creating a configuration file to automatically test and publish our code to pip or any other package manager. It will be most likely prepared for the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Other goals may be written here in the future.
